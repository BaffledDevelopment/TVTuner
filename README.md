# TVTuner
Tool to tune your TV

Basically some Selenium scripts to click various buttons on TradingView website.
I have implemented general functionality like:
1) open input tab of a strategy
2) fiddle with said input entries
3) reload and parse the profitability, amount of orders etc etc etc from panel below.
4) Genetic Algo selects the bestest inputs and minmaxes them further (by the idea)  
5) entries and buttons are hardcoded to no avail.
6) code will break at will

I wont be using this anymore, there are way better tools to backtest your strategies, but it was a nice back on the envelope experiment
